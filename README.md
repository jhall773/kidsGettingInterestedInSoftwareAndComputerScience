# kidsGettingInterestedInSTEM
Hi. This application is a project for my Undergraduate Engeneering Design Course at St. Mary's University in San Antonio, Texas. 
This multipage app is designed to get more kids interested and involved in STEM.

I have 2 group undergraduate memebers who worked with me:
-Joel (Mechanical Engineering Major): Responsible for the main mechanical/electrical details in the industrial drawings and systems in our interactive models.
-Javier (Engineering Project Management Major): Helped with project flow and execution. Helped find information for majors and and designed our interactive placement quiz.
